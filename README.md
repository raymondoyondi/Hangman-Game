My first Python project. Includes a package - 'hangman' - with all methods required to build the game.

When you run this Python script, it will choose a word from the word list in hangman.py. It will show you how many letters are there in this word and asks you to enter a letter. You will get 8 chances to guess a right word. Your chances will be reduced whenever you guess wrong.
